### About the POWDER KEG

<br />

POWDER KEG is a popup purveyor of fine explosives. This application helps the fine POWDER KEG folks keep everything under the POWDER KEG tent under POWDER KEG control&mdash;contained, if you will.

That means tracking inventory to make sure something strange doesn't just pop off into thin air. With this application, users and inventory managers can see list/menu of all available kegs. Each keg lists its name, brand, price per unit, price per keg, quantity, and type (e.g., M-80, sparkler, smoke bomb, etc.). Users can submit a form to add a new keg to a list and click on a keg to see its detail page, where a detail view displays how many fireworks are left in each keg. (The quantity of fireworks in each keg will vary.) Users can also click a button next to a keg whenever a firework is sold.

## **Acknowledgements**

<br />

This project was developed alongside the [LearnHowToProgram curriculum](learnhowtoprogram.com) at Epicodus, a coding bootcamp in Portland, Oregon.

This app would not have been possible without [John Edmondson](https://github.com/basicjohn), [Tom Geraghty](https://github.com/Usarneme) and [Jeremy Banka](https://github.com/jeremybanka), whose extensive knowledge and experience in React and design helped me grapple with the basics of state and introduced me to more efficient syntax, inline styling, ternary operators, helpful ES Lint configurations and even (god bless it) an [incredible Arabic typeface](https://yanone.de/). Equally critical to this app was the tutelage of Epicodus instructors [Erik Irgens](https://github.com/erik-t-irgens) and [James Henager](https://github.com/jhenager), whose consistent presence and demos of state and classic RPG victory jingles have been instrumental in keeping the torrid pace of Epicodus managable.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
